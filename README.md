Made this because it was a friend's assignment and it sounded fun. Two players take turns rolling a 6-sided die. Each player can roll as many times as they want in one turn but if they roll a 1 their turn ends and their score is 0 for that turn. If they choose to stop rolling then the sum of their rolls gets added to their total score. First to a total of 100 wins.
